    <h1>Tramonique Wellington</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I am a Computer Science student who spends a lot of time convincing code that it should work and occasionally celebrating when it finally does. 
        Most of my day is spent procrastinating and internally panicking before realizing that what I had to do was never that difficult to begin with.<br>
        When I'm not begging for my cat's affection, I'm playing Where Winds Meet or my brain creates a completely unnecessary question and I immediately abandon all of my responsibilities to dive down a Reddit rabbit hole for three hours as if I have been personally assigned the task by the internet.<br>
        Now look at my baby! <3
    </p>
