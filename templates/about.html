    <h1>Tramonique Wellington</h1>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student who spends a lot of time convincing code to work and occasionally celebrating when it finally does. 
        Most of my day is procrastinating and internally panicking before realizing it was a missing semicolon.
        When I am not fighting my cats, my brain creates a completely unnecessary question and I immediately abandon my responsibilities to research it for three hours like I have been personally assigned the task by the internet.</p>
